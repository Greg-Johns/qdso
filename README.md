## Quick Draw Shoot Out

QDSO is a experiment in gaming using blockchains, smart contracts & [ERC-721â€™s](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

The original idea started a few years back when Google released a artificial intelligence tool called [Quick Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) that gave a user a __random__ word and then used A.I. to guess what was being drawn. While this was fun the idea of adding human competitors got stuck in my head and rattled around for a while. Fast forward to 2021 and now we have blockchains and Non-Fungible Tokens to add to the idea. Let's mix this some.
